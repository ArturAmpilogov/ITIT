description: 'Cassandra is a distributive database where each node has equal rights in processing requests (all nodes are primarary).
              As a NoSQL database, Cassanrda allows to choose availability or consistency. 
              Assume that a project chooses availability over consistency, i.e. some data can be written to node 1 and node 2, but yet not to node 3, and the request comes to node 3.
              All nodes in the system are equal, how to get the latest result from node 3?
              
              Cassandra solution: Set up the minimum number of nodes that should be requested by the processing request node (node 3 in this case).
              For example, consistency of factor 3 is chosen. It means node should request node 1 and node 2, compare the values and return the result.
              How to compare the values? A recoded with the latest timestamp (or version) wins.
