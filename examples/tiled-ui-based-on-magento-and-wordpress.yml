description: 'The client requested to create a web shop. Magento CMS system was introduced. It is a classical .NET MVC Web aplication. 
              UI (HTML) rendering and requests processing, everything happens on the server side.
              Then client asked for a featuer to write blog post or goods description, and not as a separate website URL, but exactly as part of other pages.
              Magento does not include this feature. There is a famouse Wordpress Blog system that suie well the requirement.
              
              How to use two different systems and make a UI displaying these systems on one page?
              Solution: Use Magento and Wordpress as server API. For the UI part use custom HTML UI based on React or VueJS.
              Make requests to different backend APIs (Magento API, Wordpress API), display the results on UI.
              UI becomes as a tile of different systems. One part displays goods and prices from shop, another part displays blog posts, all on the same page.
              The UI can be modified to include other APIs from different vendors (translation module, maps, etc.).'
