name: 'AWS Snowball'
description: 'A client wants to upload large organisation data to a cloud service. 
              The internet speed is limited and the uploading all the data might take months.
              Amazon solution: Amazon sends a box 'Snowball' containing fast hard drives to the client's office. 
                               The box can be connected via the fastest available network interfaces. The data is encrypted for safety.
                               After data uploading, the client sends the box to the Amazon data center.
              There is a similar approach in the (AWS Snowmobile|ref:aws-snowmobile.yml).
