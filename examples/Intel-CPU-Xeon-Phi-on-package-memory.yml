name: 'Intel CPU Xeon Phi on-package memory'
description: 'On-board memory, such as DDR plank, is placed in special motherboard slots.
              The distance between CPU and DDR can be 15 sm, and transfering electroning signals takes time.
              The total speed of all DDR-4 channels for Intel Xeon Phe Gen 2 processor is 90 GB/s.
              How to increase the speed.
              Intel solution: Place memory directly on CPU package, and use more channels for data transfer.
              With memory type called Multi-Channel DRAM (MCDRAM) the speed was increased on Xeon Phi processor up to 500 GB/s.
              The limitation is the capacity of memory due the chip size and production technology. 
              If DDR-4 could hold TB of data, MCDRAM on-package was limited by 16 GB.
              MCDRAM can be used programmatically as a standalone memory resourse (flat mode), or automatically as a cache between CPU L2 cache level and DDR-4 (cache mode), or in a hybrid aproach "flat+cache"'
