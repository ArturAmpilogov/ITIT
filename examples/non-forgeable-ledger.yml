description: 'How can one certify when a document (a text, an audio, a video file, a financial transaction) was created or last modified?.
              This is especially important for intellegent documnets - patents.
              One idea is to use a central service that will timestamp the document and sign it. The authority of the sign can be verified.
              How one can ensure that the central service will not cheat, for example, by setting an old or a far future date to the document?
              Solution: 
              Use a ledger of records. Each record contains a link (hash) to the previous record. 
              Plus compute the hash of the whole record itself, including the previos link. Send back the data to the client with the computed hash.
              The client can approve that the document was signed by the central organization. 
              While the central organization cannot set the back or future dates, otherwise breaking the the already published ledger sequence.'
