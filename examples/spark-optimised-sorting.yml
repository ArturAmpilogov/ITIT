name: 'Spark optimised sorting'
description: 'Apache Spark is an application for fast processing of distrubuted datasets.
              To sort list of objects it might require several jumps through memory references to get the value for each item, for example, `&account -> &passport -> &name`.              
              Often the value is a meidum or long length string. 
              To compare two strings the values should be loaded to a local CPU cache, small in size but the fastest.              
              How to sort more data in a limited CPU cache?
              Spark solution: Use AlphaSort.
              1) Store small record prefix (number or string) near an object memory reference: "prefix+ref".
              2) Sort "prefix+ref" records that perfectly fit in CPU cache lines. If prefixes are equal, then compare values by evaluating the reference chain.
              
              This solution requires preparation of records, and at least two reference evaluations: first time when prefix should be calculated, second time when the value should be sent to output.
              The gain here is that more data can be put to the fastest CPU caches for sorting. 
              Only the short prefix is transfered from RAM to CPU chache instead of the full string in a usual sort method.
              
              The solution is optimal only if string values are long enough. 
              Otherwise, it is faster to store full short string values directly into CPU cache without reference locations, then sort and output data.'
