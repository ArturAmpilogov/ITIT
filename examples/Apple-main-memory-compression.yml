name: 'Apple main memory compression'
description: 'RAM (main) memory is 50-200 times faster that FLash/SSD disks.
              At the same time, main memory has large power consumption in the system beacause it should be refreshed every N ms to prevent current leakage.
              Larger main memory gives computer (mobile, tablet, laptop) perfomance but requires more electric power. 
              How to increase main memory without power reduction?
              
              Apple solution: Track memory pages with "recreatable" data called "clean memory", for example, framework library, OS library and application binaries.
              If there is not enough main memory, then the least used "clean" memory is "cleaned out". In case of future need it is realoaded.
              If there is not enough space even after cleaning, then the main memory is compressed on the fly by Wilson-Kaplan WKdm algorithm.
              
              For years Apple iPhone models had twice less RAM capacity than competetive Android models, and at the same time iPhone could hold twice more applications in memory.
              The same situation happened with Apple Macbook version. 
              While most of laptop manufactures jumped to 32GB RAM holding 3-5 hours of work on battery, Apple stayed for a long time with 16GB RAM models ahieving 8-10 hours of work on battery.'
