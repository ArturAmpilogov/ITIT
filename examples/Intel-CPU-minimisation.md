name: 'Intel CPU minimisation'
description: 'Scientific tasks, such as whether prediction, simulation of particles interraction, economic behaviour simulation, machine learning, require enormous number of operations on numbers.
              The super computer "ASCI Red 1997" had 9632  Intel Perntium II processors with the total computation power of 2.38 Teraflops floating number operations.
              This computer was a cluster of multiple machine cabinets and took the space of 230 squared meters.
              19 years later, Intel presented Intel Xeon Phi 7200 series processors having the size of an adult's palm and the power of more than 2.6 Teraflops.'
