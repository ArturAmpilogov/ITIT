description: 'Apache Spark is an application for fast processing of distrubuted datasets.
              Spark, before processing, divides the large data on smaller parts and distributes them among computer nodes called "workers".
              Sorting requires memory jump by reference to get the actual values for comparison. 
              Refernces can lead to chain of jumps, and each call is a slow operation.
              Spark solution: Store small record prefix (numbers, strings) near a record reference. 
              At first step, the pre-sort method is done fast by prefixes, then the records can be sorted fully using reference jumps. 
              Data movement in memory is reduced.
              Another benefit is that manager node needs to decide what give to a worker node for local sorting. 
              For example, worker 1 should receive records having field "name" and starting with "A". Prefix compare is an immediate oprarion for such case.
